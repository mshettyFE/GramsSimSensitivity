    <!-- The parameters in this section are meant to apply to all the
         programs. However, you can override them within the
         individual program blocks, though it's probably more useful
         to override them on the command line. Be careful about what
         you're overriding, especially the unit options. -->

    the default value of the 'options' option is "options.xml" -->

        If you want to, you can include text like this within an option
        tag. You can use this for additional documentation. The program
        does not read or interpret it.

         Length unit: as of Jan-2022, the only valid values are "cm" and "mm".
         Energy unit: as of Jan-2022, the only valid values are "MeV" and "GeV".
	 Time unit: as of Jan-2022, the only valid values are "ns", "ms", and "s".
     
         This does not directly affect the GDML file (.gdml) and
         Geant4 macro files (.mac), as any dimensioned quantities in
         those files have units specified explicitly.

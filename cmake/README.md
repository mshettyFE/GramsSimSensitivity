# cmake scripts

Like most "cmake" directories within a distribution, this directory
contains build scripts for packages that are external to the main
distribution described in CMakeLists.txt.

I copied this from [GramsSim](https://github.com/wgseligman/GramsSim), which in turn copied from Beam Delivery
Simulation (BDSIM), developed at the University of London.

`ROOT.cmake` - As the name suggests, set up compilation with ROOT.

`HepMC3.cmake` - Set up compilation with HepMC3.

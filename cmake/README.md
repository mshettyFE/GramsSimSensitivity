# cmake scripts

Like most "cmake" directories within a distribution, this directory
contains build scripts for packages that are external to the main
distribution described in CMakeLists.txt.

Pretty much everything in this directory is copied from Beam Delivery
Simulation (BDSIM), developed at the University of London.

`ROOT.cmake` - As the name suggests, set up compilation with ROOT.

`HepMC3.cmake` - Set up compilation with HepMC3.
